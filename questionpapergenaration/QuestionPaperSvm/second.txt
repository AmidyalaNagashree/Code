CPU registers are the registers that vary in number and type, depending on the computer architecture. 
 Restricting a child process to a subset of the parent's resources prevents any process from overloading the system by creating too many subprocesses. 
 Cpu-scheduling information is that information which includes a process priority, pointers to scheduling queues, and any other scheduling parameters.
CPU registers are the registers that vary in number and type, depending on the computer architecture. 
 The objective of time sharing is to switch the CPU among processes so frequently that users can interact with each program while it is running.
When a contextswitch occurs, the kernel saves the context of the old process in its PCB and loads the saved context of the new process scheduled to run.
The objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times, to maximize CPU utilization.
