CPU registers are the registers that vary in number and type, depending on the computer architecture. 
Each process is represented in the operating systemby a process control block (PCB)-also called a task control block. 
If it takes 10 milliseconds to decide to execute a process for 100 milliseconds, then 10/(100 + 10) = 9 percent of the CPU is being used (wasted)simply for scheduling the work. 
CPU registers are the registers that vary in number and type, depending on the computer architecture. 
 A process is the unit of work in a modern time-sharing system.
When a contextswitch occurs, the kernel saves the context of the old process in its PCB and loads the saved context of the new process scheduled to run.
The objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times, to maximize CPU utilization.
